<ul>
<li>A company needs to deploy virtual desktops to its customers in a virtual private cloud, leveraging existing security controls. Which set of AWS services and features will meet the company’s requirements?

<ul>
<li>Virtual Private Network connection. AWS Directory Services, and ClassicLink (ClassicLink allows you to link an EC2-Classic instance to a VPC in your account, within the same region)</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Private Network connection. AWS Directory Services, and Amazon Workspaces (WorkSpaces for Virtual desktops, and AWS Directory Services to authenticate to an existing on-premises AD through VPN)</strong></li>

<li>With which AWS services CloudHSM can be used (select 2)

<ul>
<li>S3</li>
<li>DynamoDb</li>
<li><strong>RDS</strong></li>
<li>ElastiCache</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Redshift</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="aws-cloudsearch">AWS CloudSearch</h3>

<ul>
<li>A newspaper organization has an on-premises application which allows the public to search its back catalogue and retrieve individual newspaper pages via a website written in Java. They have scanned the old newspapers into JPEGs (approx. 17TB) and used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to populate a commercial search product. The hosting platform and software is now end of life and the organization wants to migrate its archive to AWS and produce a cost efficient architecture and still be designed for availability and durability. Which is the most appropriate?

<ul>
<li>Use S3 with reduced redundancy to store and serve the scanned files, install the commercial search application on EC2 Instances and configure with auto-scaling and an Elastic Load Balancer. (Reusing Commercial search application which is nearing end of life not a good option for cost)</li>
<li>Model the environment using CloudFormation. Use an EC2 instance running Apache webserver and an open source search application, stripe multiple standard EBS volumes together to store the JPEGs and search index. (storing JPEGs on EBS volumes not cost effective also answer does not address Open source solution availability)</li>
<li><strong>Use S3 with standard redundancy to store and serve the scanned files, use CloudSearch for query processing, and use Elastic Beanstalk to host the website across multiple availability zones. (Cost effective S3 storage, CloudSearch for Search and Highly available and durable web application)</strong></li>
<li>Use a single-AZ RDS MySQL instance to store the search index and the JPEG images use an EC2 instance to serve the website and translate user queries into SQL. (MySQL not an ideal solution to sore index and JPEG images for cost and performance)</li>
<li>Use a CloudFront download distribution to serve the JPEGs to the end users and Install the current commercial search product, along with a Java Container for the website on EC2 instances and use Route53 with DNS round-robin. (Web Application not scalable, whats the source for JPEGs files through CloudFront)</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p>You need to perform ad-hoc analysis on log data, including searching quickly for specific error codes and reference numbers. Which should you evaluate first?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AWS Elasticsearch Service</strong> (Elasticsearch Service (ES) is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch clusters in the AWS cloud. Elasticsearch is a popular open-source search and analytics engine for use cases such as log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and click stream analytics. Refer link)</li>
<li>AWS RedShift</li>
<li>AWS EMR</li>
<li>AWS DynamoDB</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>You are hired as the new head of operations for a SaaS company. Your CTO has asked you to make debugging any part of your entire operation simpler and as fast as possible. She complains that she has no idea what is going on in the complex, service-oriented architecture, because the developers just log to disk, and it’s very hard to find errors in logs on so many services. How can you best meet this requirement and satisfy your CTO?</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy all log files into AWS S3 using a cron job on each instance. Use an S3 Notification Configuration on the <code>PutBucket</code> event and publish events to AWS Lambda. Use the Lambda to analyze logs as soon as they come in and flag issues.</li>
<li>Begin using CloudWatch Logs on every service. Stream all Log Groups into S3 objects. Use AWS EMR cluster jobs to perform adhoc MapReduce analysis and write new queries when needed.</li>
<li>Copy all log files into AWS S3 using a cron job on each instance. Use an S3 Notification Configuration on the <code>PutBucket</code> event and publish events to AWS Kinesis. Use Apache Spark on AWS EMR to perform at-scale stream processing queries on the log chunks and flag issues.</li>
<li><strong>Begin using CloudWatch Logs on every service. Stream all Log Groups into an AWS Elasticsearch Service Domain running Kibana 4 and perform log analysis on a search cluster.</strong> (AWS Elasticsearch with Kibana stack is designed specifically for real-time, ad-hoc log analysis and aggregation)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

If the organization wants to save them in a cost effective way, which is the best possible solution?

<ul>
<li>AWS RRS</li>
<li>AWS S3</li>
<li>AWS RDS</li>
<li><strong>AWS Glacier</strong></li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>The archive will be available as an object for the duration specified by the user during the restoration request</li>
<li><strong>The restored object’s storage class will be RRS (After the object is restored the storage class still remains GLACIER.)</strong></li>
<li>The user can modify the restoration period only by issuing a new restore request with the updated period</li>
<li>The user needs to pay storage for both RRS (restored) and Glacier (Archive) Rates<br /></li>

<h3 id="aws-data-pipeline">AWS Data Pipeline</h3>

<ul>
<li>An International company has deployed a multi-tier web application that relies on DynamoDB in a single region. For regulatory reasons they need disaster recovery capability in a separate region with a Recovery Time Objective of 2 hours and a Recovery Point Objective of 24 hours. They should synchronize their data on a regular basis and be able to provision the web application rapidly using CloudFormation. The objective is to minimize changes to the existing web application, control the throughput of DynamoDB used for the synchronization of data and synchronize only the modified elements. Which design would you choose to meet these requirements?

<ul>
<li><strong>Use AWS data Pipeline to schedule a DynamoDB cross region copy once a day. Create a ‘Lastupdated’ attribute in your DynamoDB table that would represent the timestamp of the last update and use it as a filter.</strong></li>
<li>Use EMR and write a custom script to retrieve data from DynamoDB in the current region using a SCAN operation and push it to DynamoDB in the second region. (No Schedule and throughput control)</li>
<li>Use AWS data Pipeline to schedule an export of the DynamoDB table to S3 in the current region once a day then schedule another task immediately after it that will import data from S3 to DynamoDB in the other region. (With AWS Data pipeline the data can be copied directly to other DynamoDB table)</li>
<li>Send each item into an SQS queue in the second region; use an auto-scaling group behind the SQS queue to replay the write in the second region. (Not Automated to replay the write)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="elastic-transcoder">Elastic Transcoder</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your website is serving on-demand training videos to your workforce. Videos are uploaded monthly in high resolution MP4 format. Your workforce is distributed globally often on the move and using company-provided tablets that require the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol to watch a video. Your company has no video transcoding expertise and it required you might need to pay for a consultant. How do you implement the most cost-efficient architecture without compromising high availability and quality of video delivery?

<ul>
<li><strong>Elastic Transcoder to transcode original high-resolution MP4 videos to HLS. S3 to host videos with lifecycle Management to archive original flies to Glacier after a few days. CloudFront to serve HLS transcoded videos from S3</strong></li>
<li>A video transcoding pipeline running on EC2 using SQS to distribute tasks and Auto Scaling to adjust the number or nodes depending on the length of the queue S3 to host videos with Lifecycle Management to archive all files to Glacier after a few days CloudFront to serve HLS transcoding videos from Glacier</li>
<li>Elastic Transcoder to transcode original high-resolution MP4 videos to HLS EBS volumes to host videos and EBS snapshots to incrementally backup original rues after a few days. CloudFront to serve HLS transcoded videos from EC2.</li>
<li>A video transcoding pipeline running on EC2 using SQS to distribute tasks and Auto Scaling to adjust the number of nodes depending on the length of the queue.

The solution must ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your log data. Which of these solutions would you recommend?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create a new CloudTrail trail with one new S3 bucket to store the logs and with the global services option selected. Use IAM roles, S3 bucket policies and Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete on the S3 bucket that stores your logs.</strong> (Single New bucket with global services option for IAM and MFA delete for confidentiality)</li>
<li>Create a new CloudTrail with one new S3 bucket to store the logs. Configure SNS to send log file delivery notifications to your management system. Use IAM roles and S3 bucket policies on the S3 bucket that stores your logs. (Missing Global Services for IAM)</li>
<li>Create a new CloudTrail trail with an existing S3 bucket to store the logs and with the global services option selected Use S3 ACLs and Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete on the S3 bucket that stores your logs. (Existing bucket prevents confidentiality)</li>
<li>Create three new CloudTrail trails with three new S3 buckets to store the logs one for the AWS Management console, one for AWS SDKs and one for command line tools.

<li>Our company is getting ready to do a major public announcement of a social media site on AWS. The website is running on EC2 instances deployed across multiple Availability Zones with a Multi-AZ RDS MySQL Extra Large DB Instance. The site performs a high number of small reads and writes per second and relies on an eventual consistency model. After comprehensive tests you discover that there is read contention on RDS MySQL. Which are the best approaches to meet these requirements? (Choose 2 answers)

<ul>
<li><strong>Deploy ElastiCache in-memory cache running in each availability zone</strong></li>
<li>Implement sharding to distribute load to multiple RDS MySQL instances</li>

<li>You have been tasked with moving an ecommerce web application from a customer’s datacenter into a VPC. The application must be fault tolerant and well as highly scalable. Moreover, the customer is adamant that service interruptions not affect the user experience. As you near launch, you discover that the application currently uses multicast to share session state between web servers, In order to handle session state within the VPC, you choose to:

<ul>
<li><strong>Store session state in Amazon ElastiCache for Redis (scalable and makes the web applications stateless)</strong></li>
<li>Create a mesh VPN between instances and allow multicast on it</li>
<li>Store session state in Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS solution not highly scalable)</li>
<li>Enable session stickiness via Elastic Load Balancing (affects user experience if the instance goes down)<br /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you are designing to support a 24-hour flash sale, which one of the following methods best describes a strategy to lower the latency while keeping up with unusually heavy traffic?

<ul>
<li>Launch enhanced networking instances in a placement group to support the heavy traffic (only improves internal communication)</li>
<li>Apply Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles instead of a 3-tier architecture (just simplifies architecture)</li>
<li>Use Elastic Beanstalk to enable blue-green deployment (only minimizes download for applications and ease of rollback)</li>
<li><strong>Use ElastiCache as in-memory storage on top of DynamoDB to store user sessions</strong> (scalable, faster read/writes and in memory storage)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You are configuring your company’s application to use Auto Scaling and need to move user state information. Which of the following AWS services provides a shared data store with durability and low latency?

<ul>
<li>AWS ElastiCache Memcached (does not provide durability as if the node is gone the data is gone)</li>
<li>Amazon Simple Storage Service</li>
<li>Amazon EC2 instance storage</li>
<li>Amazon DynamoDB</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your application is using an ELB in front of an Auto Scaling group of web/application servers deployed across two AZs and a Multi-AZ RDS Instance for data persistence. The database CPU is often above 80% usage and 90% of I/O operations on the database are reads. To improve performance you recently added a single-node Memcached ElastiCache Cluster to cache frequent DB query results. In the next weeks the overall workload is expected to grow by 30%. Do you need to change anything in the architecture to maintain the high availability for the application with the anticipated additional load and Why?

<ul>
<li><strong>You should deploy two Memcached ElastiCache Clusters in different AZs because the RDS Instance will not be able to handle the load if the cache node fails.</strong></li>
<li>If the cache node fails the automated ElastiCache node recovery feature will prevent any availability impact. (does not provide high availability, as data is lost if the node is lost)</li>
<li>Yes you should deploy the Memcached ElastiCache Cluster with two nodes in the same AZ as the RDS DB master instance to handle the load if one cache node fails. (Single AZ affects availability as DB is Multi AZ and would be overloaded is the AZ goes down)</li>
<li>No if the cache node fails you can always get the same data from the DB without having any availability impact. (Will overload the database affecting availability)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A read only news reporting site with a combined web and application tier and a database tier that receives large and unpredictable traffic demands must be able to respond to these traffic fluctuations automatically. What AWS services should be used meet these requirements?

<ul>
<li><strong>Stateless instances for the web and application tier synchronized using ElastiCache Memcached in an autoscaling group monitored with CloudWatch and RDS with read replicas.</strong></li>
<li>Stateful instances for the web and application tier in an autoscaling group monitored with CloudWatch and RDS with read replicas (Stateful instances will not allow for scaling)</li>
<li>Stateful instances for the web and application tier in an autoscaling group monitored with CloudWatch and multi-AZ RDS (Stateful instances will allow not for scaling &amp; multi-AZ is for high availability and not scaling)</li>
<li>Stateless instances for the web and application tier synchronized using ElastiCache Memcached in an autoscaling group monitored with CloudWatch and multi-AZ RDS (multi-AZ is for high availability and not scaling)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You have written an application that uses the Elastic Load Balancing service to spread traffic to several web servers. Your users complain that they are sometimes forced to login again in the middle of using your application, after they have already logged in. This is not behavior you have designed. What is a possible solution to prevent this happening?

<ul>
<li>Use instance memory to save session state.</li>
<li>Use instance storage to save session state.</li>
<li>Use EBS to save session state.</li>
<li><strong>Use ElastiCache to save session state.</strong></li>

<li>Yes, but only when right APIs are called</li>
<li>Yes, but only in Gov Cloud datacenters</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Answer: C. S3 by default do not encrypt the data stored into its service. But using Server Side Encryption feature, if proper headers are passes (in REST), S3 will first encrypt the data and then store that encrypted data.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is true for S3 buckets (select multiple if more than one is true)?

<ul>
<li>Bucket namespace is shared and is global among all AWS users.</li>
<li>Bucket names can contain alpha numeric characters</li>
<li>Bucket are associated with a region, and all data in a bucket resides in that region</li>
<li>Buckets can be transferred from one account to another through API</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Answers: A, B, C.  Bucket namespace is <strong>global</strong>, which means that if someone creates a bucket called “pics” nobody else can create a bucket of the same name. Bucket names can contain alphanumeric characters which means we can have a bucket named “cloudthat1234”. And when we create a bucket, we have to select a region for the bucket, and all data stored in that bucket is physically stored in that region only (although the data can be accessed from anywhere in the world with proper credentials).</p>

<ul>
<li>EBS can always tolerate an Availability Zone failure?

<ul>
<li>No, all EBS volume is stored in a single Availability Zone</li>
<li>Yes, EBS volume has multiple copies so it should be fine</li>
<li>Depends on how it is setup</li>
<li>Depends on the Region where EBS volume is initiated</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Answer: A. One of the known fallacies of EBS is that all the data of a single volume lives in a single Availability Zone. Thus it cannot withstand Availability zone failures.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which of the following Auto scaling CANNOT do (select multiple if more than one is true)?

<ul>
<li>Start up EC2 instances when CPU utilization is above threshold</li>
<li>Release EC2 instances when CPU utilization is below threshold</li>
<li>Increase the instance size when utilization is above threshold</li>
<li>Add more Relational Database Service (RDS) read replicas when utilization is above threshold</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Answers: A, D. RDS MultiAZ does make database a single AZ failure tolerant, as it has automatic failover feature, where the secondly will become primary and application can keep accessing the database.

<h3 id="q-1-what-is-difference-between-statefull-and-stateless-services">Q.1 What is difference between statefull and stateless services ?**</h3>

<p><strong><u>Defination according to AWS services</u></strong>
- Let&rsquo;s say that you have a web server on your EC2 instance listening on port 80. If you allow inbound connections to that port in your security group, you can successfully access it even though you haven&rsquo;t explicitly allowed the outbound communication in the other direction. That&rsquo;s thanks to the <strong>stateful</strong> nature of the security group.
Now imagine that you open up for port 80 inbound in the Network ACL instead. Since the Network ACL is <strong>stateless</strong>, you will be able to reach the server, but the response from the server will not get back to you unless explicitly allowed in the outbound section of the Network ACL configuration.</p>

<p><strong><u>Defination according to website</u></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>stateful</strong> web service will keep track of the &ldquo;state&rdquo; of a client&rsquo;s connection and data over several requests.  So for example, the client might login, select a users account data, update their address, attach a photo, and change the status flag, then disconnect.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>In a <strong>stateless</strong> web service, the server doesn&rsquo;t keep any information from one request to the next.  The client needs to do it&rsquo;s work in a series of simple transactions, and the client has to keep track of what happens between requests.   So in the above example, the client needs to do each operation separately: connect and update the address, disconnect.  Connect and attach the photo, disconnect.  Connect and change the status flag, disconnect.</p>

The current configuration initiates scaling actions based on Avg CPU utilization; however during reports of slowness, CloudWatch graphs have shown that Avg CPU remains steady at 40 percent. This is well below the alarm threshold of 60 percent. Your developers have discovered that, due to the unique design of the application, performance degradation occurs on an instance when it is processing more than 200 threads. What is the best way to ensure that your application scales to match demand?</h3>

<p>a. Launch two to six additional instances outside of the AutoScaling group to handle the additional load.
b. Populate a custom CloudWatch metric for concurrent sessions and initiate scaling actions based on that metric instead of on CPU use.
c. Empirically determine the expected CPU use for 200 concurrent sessions and adjust the CloudWatch alarm threshold to be that CPU use.
d. Add a script to each instance to detect the number of concurrent sessions. If the number of sessions remains over 200 for five minutes, have the instance increase the desired capacity of the AutoScaling group by one.

A customer has a 10 GB AWS Direct Connect connection to an AWS region where they have a web application hosted on Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (EC2). The application has dependencies on an on-premises mainframe database that uses a BASE (Basic Available. Sort stale Eventual consistency) rather than an ACID (Atomicity. Consistency isolation. Durability) consistency model. The application is exhibiting undesirable behavior because the database is not able to handle the volume of writes. How can you reduce the load on your on-premises database resources in the most cost-effective way?
A.
Use an Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) S3DistCp as a synchronization mechanism between the onpremises database and a Hadoop cluster on AWS.
B.
Modify the application to write to an Amazon SQS queue and develop a worker process to flush the queue to the on-premises database.
C.
Modify the application to use DynamoDB to feed an EMR cluster which uses a map function to write to the on-premises database.
D.
Provision an RDS read-replica database on AWS to handle the writes and synchronize the two databases using Data Pipeline.</li>

You have launched an EC2 instance with four (4) 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes attached The EC2 Instance Is EBS-Optimized and supports 500 Mbps throughput between EC2 and EBS The two EBS volumes are configured as a single RAID o device, and each Provisioned IOPS volume is provisioned with 4.000 IOPS (4 000 16KB reads or writes) for a total of 16.000 random IOPS on the instance The EC2 Instance initially delivers tthe expected 16 000 IOPS random read and write performance Sometime later in order to increase the total random I/O performance of the instance, you add an additional two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID Each volume Is provisioned to 4.000 lOPs like the original four for a total of 24.000 IOPS on the EC2 instance Monitoring shows that the EC2 instance CPU utilization increased from 50% to 70%. but the total random IOPS measured at the instance level does not increase at all. What is the problem and a valid solution?
A.
Larger storage volumes support higher Provisioned IOPS rates: increase the provisioned volume storage of each of the 6 EBS volumes to 1TB.
B.
The EBS-Optimized throughput limits the total IOPS that can be utilized use an EBS-Optimized instance that provides larger throughput.
C.
Small block sizes cause performance degradation, limiting the I’O throughput, configure the instance device driver and file system to use 64KB blocks to increase throughput.
D.
RAID 0 only scales linearly to about 4 devices, use RAID 0 with 4 EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes but increase each Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to 6.000 IOPS.
E.
The standard EBS instance root volume limits the total IOPS rate, change the instant root volume to also be a 500GB 4.000 Provisioned IOPS volume.</li>

You have recently joined a startup company building sensors to measure street noise and air quality in urban areas. The company has been running a pilot deployment of around 100 sensors for 3 months Each sensor uploads 1KB of sensor data every minute to a backend hosted on AWS. During the pilot, you measured a peak or 10 IOPS on the database, and you stored an average of 3GB of sensor data per month in the databaseThe current deployment consists of a load-balanced auto scaled Ingestion layer using EC2 instances and a PostgreSQL RDS database with 500GB standard storage.The pilot is considered a success and your CEO has managed to get the attention or some potential investors The business plan requires a deployment of at least 1O0K sensors which needs to be supported by the backend You also need to store sensor data for at least two years to be able to compare year over year Improvements. To secure funding, you have to make sure that the platform meets these requirements and leaves room forfurther scaling Which setup will meet the requirements?
A.
Add an SQS queue to the ingestion layer to buffer writes to the RDS instance
B.
Ingest data into a DynamoDB table and move old data to a Redshift cluster
C.
Replace the RDS instance with a 6 node Redshift cluster with 96TB of storage

You need a persistent and durable storage to trace call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. Call duration is mostly in the 2-3 minutes timeframe. Each traced call can be either active or terminated. An external application needs to know each minute the list of currently active calls, which are usually a few calls/second. Put once per month there is a periodic peak up to 1000 calls/second for a few hours The system is open <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> and any downtime should be avoided. Historical data is periodically archived to files. Cost saving is a priority for this project. What database implementation would better fit this scenario, keeping costs as low as possible?
A.
Use RDS Multi-AZ with two tables, one for -Active calls” and one for -Terminated calls”. In this way the “Active calls_ table is always small and effective to access.
B.
Use DynamoDB with a “Calls” table and a Global Secondary Index on a “IsActive&rsquo;” attribute that is present for active calls only In this way the Global Secondary index is sparse and more effective.
C.
Use DynamoDB with a ‘Calls” table and a Global secondary index on a ‘State” attribute that can equal to “active” or “terminated” in this way the Global Secondary index can be used for all Items in the table.
D.
Use RDS Multi-AZ with a “CALLS” table and an Indexed “STATE* field that can be equal to ‘ACTIVE” or – TERMINATED” In this way the SOL query Is optimized by the use of the Index.</li>

<p>Question 1 : QuickTechie.com has three different datacenters in Mumbai, Geneva and Navada. Which is planning to extend their data center by connecting their DC with the AWS VPC using the VPN gateway. QuickTechie.com is setting up a dynamically routed VPN connection. Select the information which is not required to setup this configuration?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The type of customer gateway, such as Cisco ASA, Juniper J-Series, Juniper SSG, Yamaha.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet-routable IP address (static) of the customer gateway&rsquo;s external interface.</p></li>

<li><p>Elastic IP ranges that the organization wants to advertise over the VPN connection to the VPC.</p></li>

<li><p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the customer gateway.</p></li>

<li><p>None of the above</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Correct Answer 3 : Exp : When you create a VPN connection, you must specify the type of routing that you plan to use. The type of routing that you select can depend on the make and model of your VPN devices. If your VPN device supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), specify dynamic routing when you configure your VPN connection. If your device does not support BGP, specify static routing. For a list of static and dynamic routing devices that have been tested with Amazon VPC, see the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud FAQs. When you use a BGP device, you don&rsquo;t need to specify static routes to the VPN connection because the device uses BGP to advertise its routes to the virtual private gateway. If you use a device that doesn&rsquo;t support BGP, you must select static routing and enter the routes (IP prefixes) for your network that should be communicated to the virtual private gateway. Only IP prefixes that are known to the virtual private gateway, whether through BGP advertisement or static route entry, can receive traffic from your VPC. We recommend that you use BGP-capable devices, when available, because the BGP protocol offers robust liveness detection checks that can assist failover to the second VPN tunnel if the first tunnel goes down. Devices that don&rsquo;t support BGP may also perform health checks to assist failover to the second tunnel when needed.</p>

<p>To use Amazon VPC with a VPN connection, you or your network administrator must designate a physical appliance as your customer gateway and configure it. We provide you with the required configuration information, including the VPN preshared key and other parameters related to setting up the VPN connection. Your network administrator typically performs this configuration. For information about the customer gateway requirements and configuration, see the Amazon VPC Network Administrator Guide. The following table lists the information that you need to have so that we can establish your VPN connection.</p>

<li><p>1 and 3</p></li>

<li><p>nbsp; nbsp; All 1,2 and 3</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Correct Answer 5 : Exp : By default, instances that you launch into a virtual private cloud (VPC) can&rsquo;t communicate with your own network. You can enable access to your network from your VPC by attaching a virtual private gateway to the VPC, creating a custom route table, and updating your security group rules.</p>

<p>You can complete this process manually, as described on this page, or let the VPC creation wizard take care of many of these steps for you. For more information about using the VPC creation wizard to set up the virtual private gateway, Although the term VPN connection is a general term, in the Amazon VPC documentation, a VPN connection refers to the connection between your VPC and your own network.</p>

Statically routed VPN connections require you to enter static routes for the network on your side of the customer gateway. BGP-advertised and statically entered route information allow gateways on both sides to determine which tunnels are available and reroute traffic if a failure occurs. We recommend that you configure your network to use the routing information provided by BGP (if available) to select an available path.

<p>Question : 4 QuickTechie.com has multiple branch offices and existing Internet connections. You also have multiple VPN connections with AWS, but wish to establish secure communication between sites. Select the correct statement.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub</p></li>

<li><p>To use the AWS VPN CloudHub, you must create a virtual private gateway with multiple customer gateways</p></li>

<li><p>To use the AWS VPN CloudHub, you must create a virtual private gateway with single customer gateways</p></li>

<li><p>1 and 2</p></li>

<li><p>1 and 3</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Correct Answer : 4 Exp : If you have multiple VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub. The VPN CloudHub operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC. This design is suitable for customers with multiple branch offices and existing Internet connections who&rsquo;d like to implement a convenient, potentially low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity between these remote offices.</p>

<p>To use the AWS VPN CloudHub, you must create a virtual private gateway with multiple customer gateways, each with unique Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). Customer gateways advertise the appropriate routes (BGP prefixes) over their VPN connections. These routing advertisements are received and re-advertised to each BGP peer, enabling each site to send data to and receive data from the other sites. The routes for each spoke must have unique ASNs and the sites must not have overlapping IP ranges. Each site can also send and receive data from the VPC as if they were using a standard VPN connection.</p>

<p>Sites that use AWS Direct Connect connections to the virtual private gateway can also be part of the AWS VPN CloudHub. For example, your corporate headquarters in New York can have an AWS Direct Connect connection to the VPC and your branch offices can use VPN connections to the VPC. The branch offices in Los Angeles and Miami can send and receive data with each other and with your corporate headquarters, all using the AWS VPN CloudHub.</p>

Next, you create a VPN connection from each customer gateway to a common virtual private gateway. Each VPN connection must advertise its specific BGP routes. This is done using the network statements in the VPN configuration files for the VPN connection. The network statements differ slightly depending on the type of router you use. When using an AWS VPN CloudHub, you pay typical Amazon VPC VPN connection rates. You are billed the connection rate for each hour that each VPN is connected to the virtual private gateway. When you send data from one site to another using the AWS VPN CloudHub, there is no cost to send data from your site to the virtual private gateway. You only pay standard AWS data transfer rates for data that is relayed from the virtual private gateway to your endpoint. For example, if you have a site in Los Angeles and a second site in New York and both sites have a VPN connection to the virtual private gateway, you pay $.05 per hour for each VPN connection (for a total of $.10 per hour). You also pay the standard AWS data transfer rates for all data that you send from Los Angeles to New York (and vice versa) that traverses each VPN connection; network traffic sent over the VPN connection to the virtual private gateway is free but network traffic sent over the VPN connection from the virtual private gateway to the endpoint is billed at the standard AWS data transfer rate.</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>The organization should plan the all 100 app server on the public subnet and oracle rds in a private subnet so it will not be in the public cloud.</p></li>

<li><p>The organization should plan the app server on the public subnet and keep the Oracle database in the organization&rsquo;s data center and connect them with the VPN gateway.</p></li>

<li><p>The organization should plan the app server on the public subnet and use RDS with the private subnet for a secure data operation.</p></li>

<li><p>The organization should use the public subnet for the app server and use RDS with a storage gateway to access as well as sync the data securely from the local data center.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Correct Answer : 2 Exp : A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. When you create a VPC, you specify the set of IP addresses for the VPC in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block (for example, 10.0.0.0/16).</p>

<p>You can optionally set up a connection between your VPC and your corporate or home network. If you have an IP address prefix in your VPC that overlaps with one of your networks&rsquo; prefixes, any traffic to the network&rsquo;s prefix is dropped. For example, let&rsquo;s say that you have the following:</p>

<pre><code>A VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16

A subnet in that VPC with CIDR block 10.0.1.0/24

Instances running in that subnet with IP addresses 10.0.1.4 and 10.0.1.5

On-premises host networks using CIDR blocks 10.0.37.0/24 and 10.1.38.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>When those instances in the VPC try to talk to hosts in the 10.0.37.0/24 address space, the traffic is dropped because 10.0.37.0/24 is part of the larger prefix assigned to the VPC (10.0.0.0/16). The instances can talk to hosts in the 10.1.38.0/24 space because that block isn&rsquo;t part of 10.0.0.0/16.</p>

<p>You can also create a VPC peering connection between your VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. A VPC peering connection enables you to route traffic between the VPCs using private IP addresses; however, you cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPCs that have overlapping CIDR blocks. For more information, see VPC Peering.</p>

<h1 id="we-therefore-recommend-that-you-create-a-vpc-with-a-cidr-range-large-enough-for-expected-future-growth-but-not-one-that-overlaps-with-current-or-expected-future-subnets-anywhere-in-your-corporate-or-home-network-or-that-overlaps-with-current-or-future-vpcs">We therefore recommend that you create a VPC with a CIDR range large enough for expected future growth, but not one that overlaps with current or expected future subnets anywhere in your corporate or home network, or that overlaps with current or future VPCs.</h1>

<li><p>Which of the following approaches provides the lowest cost for Amazon elastic block store snapshots while giving you the ability to fully restore data?
Maintain two snapshots: the original snapshot and the latest incremental snapshot.
Maintain a volume snapshot; subsequent snapshots will overwrite one another.
Maintain a single snapshot; the latest snapshot is both incremental and complete.
Maintain the most current snapshot; archive the original and increment to Amazon Glacier.
Explanation:
Answer: (A) After writing data to an EBS volume, you can periodically create a snapshot of the volume to use as a baseline for new volumes or for data backup. If you make periodic snapshots of a volume, the snapshots are incremental which means only the blocks on the device that have changed after your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot. Even though snapshots are saved incrementally, the snapshot deletion process is designed such that you need to retain only the most recent snapshot in order to restore the volume.</p></li>

<li><p>You are currently hosting multiple applications in a VPC and have logged numerous port scans coming in from a specific IP address block. Your security team has requested that all access to the offending IP address block be denied for the next 24 hours. Which of the following is the best method to quickly and temporarily deny access to the specified IP address block?
Create an AD policy to modify Windows Firewall settings on all hosts in the VPC to deny access to the IP address block.
Modify the Network ACLs (NACLs) associated with all public subnets in the VPC to deny access from the IP address block.
Modify the Windows Firewall settings on all Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) which your organization uses in that VPC to deny access from the IP address block.
Explanation:
Answer: (B) AWS has implemented security layers at every level. As per OSI layers, you can restrict access at network level using NACL rules at VPC and below subnet levels. You can configure NACL rules to allow and deny the traffic. After crossing the network layer, if you still want to configure at the instance or resource level, you can configure it using security groups. Per the above context, you need to do it at the network level for a specific period and roll back the changes. You can do this at the network layer by altering allow/deny NACL rules.</p></li>

IP address of ELB
IP address of Forward Request
IP address of client
IP address of CloudWatch
Explanation:
Answer: (A) The X-Forwarded-For request header helps you identify the IP address of a client when you use HTTP/HTTPS load balancer. Because load balancers intercept traffic between clients and servers, your server access logs contain only the IP address of the load balancer. Elastic Load Balancing stores the IP address of the client in the X-Forwarded-For request header and passes the header along to your server.</p></li>

<li><p>You have launched an instance in EC2-Classic and you want to make some change to the security group rule. How will these changes be effective?
Security group rules cannot be changed.
Changes are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group.

<li><p>Which technique can be used to integrate AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) with an on-premises LDAP (Light Weight Directory Access Protocol) directory service?
Use an IAM policy that references the LDAP account identifiers and the AWS credentials.
Use SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) to enable single sign-on between AWS and LDAP.
Use AWS security Token Service from an identity broker to issue short-lived AWS credentials.
Use IAM roles to automatically rotate the IAM credentials when LDAP credentials are updated.
Use the LDAP credentials to restrict a group of users from launching specific EC2 instance types.
Explanation:
Answer: (B) You can use SAML Identity Providers in order to integrate IAM between AWS and on premise LDAP or federated SSO implementation. For example, you want to provide a way for users to copy data from their computers to a backup folder, in your organization. You build an application that users can run on their computers. On the back end, the application reads and writes objects in an S3 bucket but the users don&rsquo;t have direct access to AWS. Instead, the application can communicate with an identity provider (IdP) to authenticate the user. The IdP gets the user information from your LDAP which is the organization&rsquo;s identity store and then generates a SAML assertion that includes authentication and authorization information about that user. The application then uses that assertion to make a call to the AssumeRoleWithSAML API to get temporary security credentials. The app can then use those credentials to access a folder in the S3 bucket that&rsquo;s specific to the user.</p></li>
