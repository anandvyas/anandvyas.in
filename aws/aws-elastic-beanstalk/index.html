            <h1>AWS Elastic Beanstalk***</h1>
            <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 22, 2017</span>
            <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.</p>

<div class="text-center">

</div>
 

<p>With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.</p>

<ul>
<li>AWS Elastic Beanstalk enables automated infrastructure management and code deployment, by simply uploading, for applications and includes

<ul>
<li>Application platform management</li>
<li>Capacity provisioning</li>
<li>Load Balancing</li>
<li>Auto scaling</li>
<li>Code deployment</li>
<li>Health Monitoring</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once an application is uploaded, Elastic Beanstalk automatically launches an environment and creates and configures the AWS resources needed to run the code. After your environment is launched, it can be managed and used to deploy new application versions</li>
<li>AWS resources launched by Elastic Beanstalk are fully accessible i.e. you can ssh into the EC2 instances</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-name-aws-elastic-beanstalk-components-elastic-beanstalk-components-a"><a name="aws-elastic-beanstalk-components">Elastic Beanstalk Components</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Application

<ul>
<li>An Elastic Beanstalk application is a logical collection of Elastic Beanstalk components, including environments, versions, and environment configurations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Application Version

<ul>
<li>An application version refers to a specific, labeled iteration of deployable code for a web application</li>
<li>Applications can have many versions and each application version is unique and points to an S3 object</li>
<li>Multiple versions can be deployed for an Application for testing differences and helps rollback to any version if case of issues</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Environment

<ul>
<li>An environment is a version that is deployed onto AWS resources</li>
<li>An environment runs a single application version at a time, but same application version can be deployed across multiple environments</li>
<li>When an environment is created, Elastic Beanstalk provisions the resources needed to run the application version you specified.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Environment Configuration

<ul>
<li>An environment configuration identifies a collection of parameters and settings that define how an environment and its associated resources behave</li>
<li>When an environment’s configuration settings is updated, Elastic Beanstalk automatically applies the changes to existing resources or deletes and deploys new resources, depending upon the change</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Configuration Template

<ul>
<li>A configuration template is a starting point for creating unique environment configurations</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-name-aws-cloudformation-vs-elastic-beanstalk-elastic-beanstalk-v-s-cloud-formation-a"><a name="aws-cloudformation-vs-elastic-beanstalk">Elastic Beanstalk V/S Cloud Formation</a></h3>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Elastic Beanstalk</th>
<th>Cloud Formation</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Elastic Beanstalk is intended to make developers&rsquo; lives easier.</td>
<td>CloudFormation is intended to make systems engineers&rsquo; lives easier.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Elastic Beanstalk is a PaaS-like layer ontop of AWS&rsquo;s IaaS services which abstracts away the underlying EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, auto scaling groups, etc. This makes it a lot easier for developers, who don&rsquo;t want to be dealing with all the systems stuff, to get their application quickly deployed on AWS. It&rsquo;s very similar to other PaaS products such as Heroku, EngineYard, Google App Engine, etc. With Elastic Beanstalk, you don&rsquo;t need to understand how any of the underlying magic works.</td>
<td>CloudFormation, on the other hand, doesn&rsquo;t automatically do anything. It&rsquo;s simply a way to define all the resources needed for deployment in a huge JSON file. So a CloudFormation template might actually create two ElasticBeanstalk environments (production and staging), a couple of ElasticCache clusters, a DyanmoDB table, and then the proper DNS in Route53. I then upload this template to AWS, walk away, and 45 minutes later everything is ready and waiting. Since it&rsquo;s just a plain-text JSON file, I can stick it in my source control which provides a great way to version my application deployments. It also ensures that I have a repeatable, &ldquo;known good&rdquo; configuration that I can quickly deploy in a different region.</td>

<ul>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk supports VPC and launches AWS resources, such as instances, into the VPC</li>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk supports IAM and helps you securely control access to your AWS resources.</li>
<li>CloudFront can be used to distribute the content in S3, after an Elastic Beanstalk is created and deployed</li>
<li>CloudTrail

<ul>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk is integrated with CloudTrail, a service that captures all of the Elastic BeanstalkAPI calls and delivers the log files to an S3 bucket that you specify.</li>
<li>CloudTrail captures API calls from the Elastic Beanstalk console or from your code to the Elastic Beanstalk APIs and help to determine the request made to Elastic Beanstalk, the source IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RDS

<ul>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk provides support for running RDS instances in the Elastic Beanstalk environment which is ideal for development and testing but not for production.</li>
<li>For a production environment, it is not recommended because it ties the lifecycle of the database instance to the lifecycle of application’s environment. So it the Elastic beanstalk environment is deleted, the RDS instance is deleted as well</li>
<li>It is recommended to launch a database instance outside of the environment and configure the application to connect to it outside of the functionality provided by Elastic Beanstalk.</li>
<li>Using a database instance external to your environment requires additional security group and connection string configuration, but it also lets the application connect to the database from multiple environments, use database types not supported with integrated databases, perform blue/green deployments, and tear down your environment without affecting the database instance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>S3

<ul>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk creates an S3 bucket named elasticbeanstalk-region-account-id for each region in which environments is created.</li>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk uses the bucket to store application versions, logs, and other supporting files.</li>
<li>It applies a bucket policy to buckets it creates to allow environments to write to the bucket and prevent accidental deletion</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
