<li><strong>Application Services</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong>: Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. Organizations can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon EC2, code running on AWS Lambda, or any web application. Amazon API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Elastic Transcoder</strong>: Amazon Elastic Transcoder is media transcoding in the cloud. It is designed to be a highly scalable and cost-effective way for developers and businesses to convert (or transcode) media files from their source formats into versions that will play back on devices like smartphones, tablets, and PCs.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</strong>: Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to recipients. In Amazon SNS, there are two types of clients—publishers and subscribers—also referred to as producers and consumers. Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by producing and sending a message to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Subscribers consume or receive the message or notification over one of the supported protocols when they are subscribed to the topic.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)</strong>: Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cost-effective email service that organizations can use to send transactional email, marketing messages, or any other type of content to their customers. Amazon SES can also be used to receive messages and deliver them to an Amazon S3 bucket, call custom code via an AWS Lambda function, or publish notifications to Amazon SNS.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF)</strong>: Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) helps developers build, run, and scale background jobs that have parallel or sequential steps. Amazon SWF can be thought of as a fully managed state tracker and task coordinator on the cloud. In common architectural patterns, if your application’s steps take more than 500 milliseconds to complete, it is vitally important to track the state of processing and to provide the ability to recover or retry if a task fails. Amazon SWF helps organizations achieve this reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)</strong>: Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully managed message queuing service. Amazon SQS makes it simple and cost effective to decouple the components of a cloud application. With Amazon SQS, organizations can transmit any volume of data, at any level of throughput, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available.</li>
